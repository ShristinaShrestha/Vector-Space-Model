 "Protein is an essential macronutrient that helps build and repair tissues, produce enzymes and hormones, and support immune function. 
Animal-based proteins such as lean meats, poultry, fish, and eggs are complete proteins, meaning they contain all essential amino acids needed by the body. 
Plant-based protein sources like beans, lentils, tofu, and quinoa are excellent alternatives, especially for vegetarians and vegans. In addition to promoting muscle growth 
and repair, protein also plays a role in maintaining healthy skin, hair, and nails. It helps regulate metabolism and can contribute to weight loss by increasing the feeling 
of fullness after meals. Dairy products, or fortified alternatives like almond milk, provide additional protein along with calcium and vitamin D, supporting bone health. 
It's crucial to balance protein intake with healthy fats and carbohydrates to ensure the body receives a complete spectrum of nutrients."
