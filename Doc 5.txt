 "Processed foods, which are often high in sugars, sodium, and unhealthy fats, can negatively impact health if consumed in excess. These foods contribute to weight 
gain, high blood pressure, and increased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. Processed foods typically contain additives and preservatives 
that can be harmful in the long term. Limiting these foods and replacing them with whole, unprocessed options like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins 
can significantly improve health outcomes. Hydration is another critical yet often overlooked aspect of a healthy lifestyle. Water is essential for maintaining body 
temperature, aiding digestion, and transporting nutrients throughout the body. Drinking enough water each day—about 8 glasses for most adults—supports energy levels, 
skin health, and the body's natural detoxification processes. Choosing water over sugary drinks can also help prevent unnecessary calorie intake and support weight management."
