 "Whole grains, such as brown rice, oats, barley, and quinoa, are essential sources of fiber, B vitamins, and minerals like magnesium and iron. 
These grains help maintain steady energy levels, regulate blood sugar, and promote heart health by reducing cholesterol levels. Fiber from whole grains supports 
digestion and can reduce the risk of gastrointestinal disorders, including colon cancer. Whole grains also help in weight management by promoting satiety and preventing 
overeating. Unlike refined grains, whole grains retain all parts of the grain kernel, which means they offer more nutrients and health benefits. Consuming whole grains 
as part of a daily diet can contribute to long-term health, prevent type 2 diabetes, and lower the risk of stroke."
