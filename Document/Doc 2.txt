"Fruits and vegetables are vital components of a well-rounded diet. 
These foods are rich in vitamins (like vitamin C and vitamin A), minerals (such as potassium and folate), and antioxidants, which are known to support immune function,
reduce oxidative stress, and lower the risk of chronic conditions like heart disease and certain cancers. Fiber from fruits and vegetables aids digestion, 
regulates bowel movements, and helps maintain a healthy weight by keeping you full for longer. Leafy greens such as spinach and kale, cruciferous vegetables like 
broccoli and cauliflower, and colorful fruits like berries, oranges, and apples are particularly beneficial. Including a variety of fruits and vegetables in daily 
meals can improve overall health and reduce the risk of nutrient deficiencies."
